## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Snowflake account with ACCOUNTADMIN access
- Cortex AI enabled (ML Functions, Search, Agent)
- Warehouse: AQUACULTURE_WH (Medium)
- AWS CLI with access (us-west-2)

### Deployment

```bash
snowsql -f snowflake/00_setup.sql
snowsql -f snowflake/01_marketplace_install.sql
snowsql -f snowflake/02_raw_tables.sql
snowsql -f snowflake/03_staging.sql
snowsql -f snowflake/04_dynamic_tables.sql
snowsql -f snowflake/05_search.sql
snowsql -f snowflake/06_ml_models.sql
snowsql -f snowflake/07_semantic_view.sql
snowsql -f snowflake/08_agent.sql
```

### React App (SPCS)
```bash
cd app && npm ci && npm run build
docker build -t aws-vietnam-aquaculture-water-quality-app .
docker push bdiqc8sm-default.registry.snowflakecomputing.com/aquaculture_water/app/aws_vietnam_aquaculture_water_quality/app:latest
```

### Demo Mode
Open the app URL with `?demo=true` for presenter view.

## Build Modes

### Snowflake Only
Run scripts 00-08 (skip AWS-specific integration). Uses:
- **Snowpipe Streaming SDK** instead of AWS IoT Core
- **ML.FORECAST + ML.ANOMALY_DETECTION** instead of Amazon SageMaker
- **Dynamic Tables** instead of AWS Glue
- **Snowflake-managed Iceberg Tables** instead of Apache Iceberg (S3)
- **Cortex Complete** instead of Amazon Bedrock (Claude)
- **Snowflake Intelligence (Cortex Analyst)** instead of Amazon QuickSight + Q

### Full AWS + Snowflake
Run all scripts including AWS integration. Deploy QuickSight dashboard from `quicksight/`.
